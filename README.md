# Public-Transportation-Demand-Prediction

This project is focused on analyzing public transportation demand data to predict the most traveled routes, probability of taking a certain route based on departure time and location, and the most probable next character in a payment reference.

The dataset used for this project comprises information about tickets purchased from Mobiticket for 14 routes from "up country" into Nairobi for 7 months.

The project tasks include:

    Finding the top 7 most traveled routes for a Sunday on average, indicate the average of each and rank them in decreasing order
    Determining the probability that a passenger traveling from Kijauri will take a Shuttle if they depart before 07:30
    Identifying the most probable next character (if any) in a payment reference based on the distribution of characters in all the payment references

The project was completed using the following steps:

    Loading the train_revised.csv file into a Pandas DataFrame
    Preprocessing the data by handling missing values and converting relevant columns to the appropriate data type
    Analyzing the data to answer each of the questions

The code is written in Python and the libraries used are pandas and numpy.

To run the code, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed on your machine. The code can be run using Jupyter notebook or any other IDE.

This project can be useful for transportation companies and city planners to optimize routes and schedules based on demand.
